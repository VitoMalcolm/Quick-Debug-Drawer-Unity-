# Quick Debug Drawer for Unity
![SomeImage](http://vitomalcolm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/QuickDebugTitle.gif)

This is a simple formatter for displaying some info in a game view with Unity IMGUI.
Support hideable panels/headers, warning/error colors, and some other nice features. I create it with Unity 5.6, but actual scripts
must be compatible with Unity 4.x and newer.
